# Blinking Paragraph

This is an exercise from an interview process I did.


## Question

Given a paragraph. Build a blinking paragraph such that each word of the paragraph needs to change to a random colour every second.

You can use any javascript library you're familiar with.

Goodluck!


## Solution

I built the solution with `React` without using the `create-react-app` tool which is what was expected.
